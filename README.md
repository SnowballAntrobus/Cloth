# Cloth

MVP:
An app that at the moment is basically "tinder for outfits". In the main screen the app creates random cobinations of items in your closet which you then rate. If you rate pass then the combination will not be shown again. If you rate like or star then the combination is added to your outfits. Your outfits and items are shown in the closet screen. The app allows you to add items with a picture and info to your closet.

I made this for learning purposes but I do intend to finish it and try to take it further.
